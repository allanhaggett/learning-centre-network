# learning-centre-network
A Wordpress TwentyTwentyOne child theme for Learning Centre sites within the iHub multisite network

The Learning Centre has numerous websites on the Innovation Hub's Wordpress multisite platform. Given 
that we are essentially a sub-network within the wider network, we are creating this child theme of 
the default TwentyTwentyOne theme so that we can add in a navigation banner for each of our sites 
to link them all together, as well as adding in any page templates that we may find useful.
