# Learning Centre Network
A map for Learning Centre sites within the iHub multisite network

The Learning Centre has numerous websites on the Innovation Hub's Wordpress multisite platform. We are 
essentially a sub-network within the wider network, based on the primary domain:

https://learningcentre.gww.gov.bc.ca/

with additional sites mapped from there; i.e. https://learningcentre.gww.gov.bc.ca/learn-at-work-week/

This repo will map the relationships that are imporant to the Learning Centre.
